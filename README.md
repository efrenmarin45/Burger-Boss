# Burger Boss

## How to install
1) Download files onto local machine
2) Install all dependencies using NPM or Yarn
3) To initialize your database on your local machine, simply update the login credentials in the connection.js file to your own

## Purpose
This program works with an existing database that uses CRUD actions. The user will be able to input a specific food item that they'd like the Burger Boss to make for them. Once the user submits their request to the waiter, the item will appear ready to be eaten. The user then has the option to continue ordering or consume their food. For each item eaten, the food will appear separately to show a record of the items eaten. Don't worry, there's no such thing as digital calories for you to worry about!

## Reflection
This project focused a lot on using the MVC (Model, Views, Controller) model and databases. I found that mapping out my files separately before pseudocoding helped a lot to keep things organized. I worked a lot with schemas and seeds in another repo that it helped make this time easier to manipulate. My only real hiccup was being able to successfully deploy via Heroku which after diving into the documentation, I was able to clear up my bugs and deploy correctly.
